# Automatically check AU Stads for new grades

You'll need to set the following environment variables:
- CLOCKWORK_KEY: API key for the Clockwork service which sends the notification text
- LOG_ID: Your unique ID for the now-logs module, which streams real time logs
- AU_USERNAME: Your AU username
- AU_PASSWORD: Your AU password
- CURRENT_GRADES: The current amount of grades before running the script

## Disclaimer
Just a dirty hacky hacky script which takes away the burden to check AU's site for new grades.
