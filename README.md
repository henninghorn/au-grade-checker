# Automatically check AU Stads for new grades

You'll need to set the following environment variables:
- CLOCKWORK_KEY: API key for the Clockwork service which sends the notification text
- LOG_ID: Your unique ID for the now-logs module, which streams real time logs
- AU_USERNAME: Your AU username
- AU_PASSWORD: Your AU password
- CURRENT_GRADES: The current amount of grades before running the script

## Disclaimer
Just a dirty hacky hacky script which takes away the burden to check AU's site for new grades when you're waiting for them to be released.

## But why
I was getting very inpatient, so I kept checking AU's systems very often.
So I thought I wanted to automate the process, so that I could simply get a text when a new grade was added to my file.
